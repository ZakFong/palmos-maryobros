  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
         YOU MUST REMOVE ANY PREVIOUS VERSIONS BEFORE INSTALLATION
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  HOW TO PLAY:
  ============

  Start Maryo Bros  by tapping on the application icon in  the application
  launcher.  After a  short while,  you will be  presented  with  the main 
  Maryo  Bros  screen  in  which  you  may  start  the game  or setup  any 
  configuration options.

  The water  pipes in  Maryo's house  are blocked with crawling creatures. 
  Help  Maryo knock the pipe pests off the floors using  the  hard keys or 
  the  stylus.  You  may  configure  the  key  and  sound  volume  in  the 
  configuration  screen.  You get  to  this by  selecting  the  menu  item  
  'Config'  in the  'Game'  menu.  Consult your handheld device manual for 
  instructions  of selecting  a menu item. When a game is active,  you may 
  tap  the  speaker icon  at the bottom  left  of the screen to get to the  
  configuration screen.  It  is  possible  to  pause the  current  game in 
  progress by tapping the paw icon.

  REGISTRATION:
  =============
 
  Maryo Bros  is shareware,  the demonstration version  does not allow the 
  player to generate high score  codes or advance past the third phase. To 
  access  these  features,  a device identification  number is required to 
  generate a unique unlocking registration datafile.

  You can get to the registration screen by  selecting the 'Register' menu 
  item in the 'Game' menu.  It is very  important to ensure  that you copy 
  down the device identification exactly as it is presented in this dialog
  as follows:

   45:6D:75:6C:61:74:6F:72:39 <--- generated from the "Emulator" username

  It is  very common that users copy down this information incorrectly and
  hence delay the registration process. An exact match is required for the
  restration process to succeed.

  REGISTRATION IS  $7.50 and  can  be  made  at  PalmGearHQ  and  are  not 
  refundable.  Once  your  purchase  is  made,  you  will receive a serial 
  number that you will then need to  enter when  you fill in survey at the  
  following web address:

   http://www.ardiri.com/index.php?redir=palm&cat=maryobros&subcat=survey

  Payments support future developments and the developer.  If you paid for 
  this software in another manner -  you have been ripped off.  Report any 
  occurances by sending an email to aaron@ardiri.com

  To be included the the  global high score table (http://www.ardiri.com),
  send an  email to aaron@ardiri. com with  the information  shown  in the 
  'Register Your Score'  dialog.  This will  only appear  if you  beat the 
  internal high  score for each game type,  or if you request it using the
  menu option under the 'Score' menu on the main page.
 
  Thankyou for downloading and playing Maryo Bros!
